# Acorn

[Acorn](https://github.com/roots/acorn) allows you to lazy-load Laravel functionality like [Blade templates](blade-templates.md), [View Composers](composers.md), Service Providers, and more into your WordPress plugins and themes.

In Sage specifically, it's used for Blade templates, Composers, Components, and a number of other helpers.

Most of Acorn just exists to integrate Laravel into WordPress, so if you're looking for documentation on features, most of what you can find in the [Laravel Documentations](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/) applies.

Acorn also includes a powerful set of WP-CLI commands that can help you manage your site and develop new features.
To see what it can do, run `wp acorn`.
